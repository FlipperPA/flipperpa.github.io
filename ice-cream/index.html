  <h1>Tim's Sugar-Free Ice Cream Recipes</h1>

  <p>Ninja Creami offers two types of machines; one with 16 oz tubs, one with 24 oz tubs. My recipes are to make three 24 oz tubs at the same time. If you're using the 16 oz machines, you can make four 16 oz tubs with the same recipes, just use slightly less milk and heavy whipping cream, since you'll be making 64 oz instead of 72 oz total.</p>

  <h2>Almost-Healthy Deluxe Chocolate</h2>

  <p>This recipe uses protein powder. I haven't tried flavors other than chocolate, but I bet they'd be good too.</p>

  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000GIQT2O?th=1">Optimum Nutrition Gold Standard 100% Whey Protein Powder, Double Rich Chocolate</a>: I've tried a bunch of brands, and this tastes and mixes best.</li>
    <li><a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000SRHVU2?th=1">Jell-O Chocolate Fudge Zero Sugar</a>: gives an amazing texture and a little more chocolately taste.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Recipe</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Using a 4-cup measuring cup, put about two cups of Protein Powder into a large mixing bowl.</li>
    <li>Take 4 tablespoons of cream cheese (half of a Philadelphia Cream Cheese bar) and microwave it for a minute in the 4-cup measuring cup.</li>
    <li>Mix in 1/3 cup of Splenda Monk Fruit Sweetener with the cream cheese; mix with a rubber batter spatula until it looks like frosting. This should only take a minute.</li>
    <li>Scrape the frosted mixture in the large mixing bowl. Add the box of Jell-O Chocolate Fudge mix.</li>
    <li>Add 4 cups of milk (3.5 cups if you're using 16 oz tubs)</li>
    <li>Add 3 cups of heavy whipping cream (2.75 cups if you're using 16 oz tubs)</li>
    <li>Using the immersion blender, mix it all together for a few minutes. You can use the batter spatula as well to scrape the powder. It should look like very thick chocolate milk when done.</li>
    <li>Pour the finished product into your tubs (either three 24 oz tubs, or four 16 oz tubs)</li>
    <li>Put the lids on the tubs, and freeze for at least 24 hours before mixing in your Ninja Creami.</li>
  </ul>
