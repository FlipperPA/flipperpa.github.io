  <h1>Tim's Sugar-Free Ice Cream Recipes</h1>

  Ninja Creami offers two types of machines; one with 16 oz tubs, one with 24 oz tubs. My recipes are to make three 24 oz tubs at the same time. If you're using the 16 oz machines, you can make four 16 oz tubs with the same recipes, just use slightly less milk and heavy whipping cream, since you'll be making 64 oz instead of 72 oz total.
