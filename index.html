					<h2>Wharton Research Data Services</h2>
					<p class="subDetails">2008 - Present (Multiple Roles)</p>
					<p>
						<ul>
							<li>Technical leader who has introduced new technologies enhancing the WRDS platform. These technologies have impacted hundreds of thousands of users across the world, and include the four core technologies of the WRDS platform: Python, Django, Wagtail, and PostgreSQL.</li>
							<li>Led the six-year project to convert WRDS from ColdFusion to Django in concert with the WRDS Web Team. This project was a very significant undertaking, requiring communications across the team, buy-in from all sides of WRDS, and commitment from our leadership to realize the benefits of such a broad endeavor. I led many sub-projects, trained our staff, was available for consultation, and built out the infrastructure.</li>
							<li>Championed Python and Django to become Wharton's preferred web technologies through the Wharton Computing DevTAP process. Served as co-lead on the Wharton implementation team and helped Penn's ISC with their implementation.</li>
							<li>Joined the Query Manager project midway: led a team of software engineers to see the project to completion as a success. Built workers for SAS, PostgreSQL, and SOLR which run over one million WRDS queries per year.</li>
							<li>Architected and developed the new WRDS permissions system, which ensures users and subscribers only have access to the data they subscribe to. Conceived and developed the new Compound Products system, which allows certain permissions to only be given when subscribed to a certain combination of other products.</li>
							<li>Directed the introduction of PostgreSQL, which allowed WRDS to replace SQL Server, Oracle SQL, and MySQL with a single database. Worked with the team to migrate WRDS research data to PostgreSQL, and led the conversion to UTF-8 to support international character sets.</li>
							<li>Designed and implemented the WRDS web infrastructure, including Ansible, Apache, mod_wsgi, and integration with HA Proxy for load balancing.</li>
							<li>Led the technical team of the WRDS Salesforce implementation, designing a repeatable data export system to migrate data from Microsoft Dynamics, and synchronizing data through the Salesforce API. Found a major bug in Salesforce in 2022 that affected the entire world, and worked with Salesforce for three months to compose a solution.</li>
							<li>Worked with colleagues in Penn's legal department, ISC, and SEAS to negotiate a contract with GitHub to offer GitHub Enterprise Campus to Penn at no cost. Implemented Single Sign-On with PennKey and provided promotion and assistance to migrate various groups on campus to the centralized service which helps Penn faculty, staff, and students break down silos and collaborate on projects.</li>
							<li>Led the conversion from HTML and Perl to ColdFusion as the director of the Web Team.</li>
							<li>Wrote the winning proposal to host DjangoCon US 2016 at Wharton, and assembled a team of ten Wharton volunteers to host and worked with Wharton Operations. Served as liaison between Wharton the the DjangoCon US organization team to ensure the conference was a success. (https://2016.djangocon.us)</li>
							<li>Upgraded and modernized OTIS, the WRDS Online Trading and Investment Simulator, including a responsive design and payment integration with CyberSource.</li>
							<li>Developed and deployed the Classroom by WRDS website, along with working on various teaching tools.</li>
							<li>Conceived and developed the WRDS API, initially for Goldman-Sachs, which now powers the WRDS data browser and other WRDS web features.</li>
							<li>Helped run the 2018 TBSr conference, hosted by WRDS.</li>
							<li>Worked to release appropriate products as open-source, accepting code from contributors, and built relationships with the open-source communities of key products in the WRDS technology stack.</li>
							<li>Promoted collaboration across the University as an organizer of DEV-SIG. Created tools for developers, such as a Vagrant and an on-server development environment.</li>
							<li>Created Ansible playbooks for installation of full Python/Django environments on Linux, to ensure installation and configuration was consistent across all instances.</li>
							<li>Integrated CyberSource as our payment processor, and developed code for ColdFusion, PHP, and Python in use across the University.</li>
							<li>Serves as the WRDS SQL Administrator, version control administrator, and domain administrator. Oversaw or participated in upgrades from ColdFusion 8 through 16, SQL Server 2005 through 2016, Django 1.8 through 2.1, PostgreSQL 9.4 to 10.1, and RedHat Linux 7.0 to 7.6.</li>
							<li>Worked on the team to launch "new WRDS web site", a full rewrite in 2009.</li>
							<li>Developed a system to automate Unix system tasks through a web-based control panel.</li>
							<li>Championed and helped implement a single sign-on LDAP solution which allowed our interactive service for 40,000 users (SSH) to move to Oracle Grid Engine on our private cloud, replacing a legacy single server (Sun E20000).</li>
							<li>Managed a team of three developers. The team also developed a Community based section using WordPress, BuddyPress, and custom plugins to make it appear seamless with the rest of the web site, a private "Stack Overflow" type of question and answer system.</li>
							<li>Developed a new Company Identifier Search across 200 data products with about 30 million individual companies spanning the globe.</li>
							<li>I continue to mentor junior developers across Wharton and the University, and recommend candidates for many positions. Many of these candidates have gone on to become key contributors across the University.</li>
